# Decided to create a music player with all of my favourite lofi songs from beephop

[Here is the design of the whole player, pretty rusty but good enough to keep you on track](https://www.figma.com/file/gnEpTrgmjuY9bnR4xu4RXg/Music-app?type=design&node-id=4%3A239&t=sjjbOnfVdzzzIwYG-1https://).

you can also find the live version of the webapp [here](https://endearing-concha-68e040.netlify.app/) :) i couldnt wait to start using it....

# whats next?

1. Am hooking up the data to firebase to make updateing the collection more dynamic.
2. Adding a drag functioality to the library-songs, i dont have to but ermmm...who's feeling like a react ninja? me!.
3. update the favicon, dont know what to use yet.
